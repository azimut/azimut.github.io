I have 6 years of professional experience working as a /system administrator/. I managed fleets of hundreds of servers running with strict SLAs. I managed a shared web hosting platform based on *LAMP*, a shared email platform based on qmail. Troubleshooted customer support escalations. And single-handedly migrating operative systems to *Red Hat* using *Ansible*.

For the past years I tried different programming languages to learn different ways to solve problems and the pain points of the development process that can be solved with a better infrastructure. Including bits of *Erlang*, where I got reminded of the challenges of distributed systems, of which I got a taste while working with *Kubernetes*. Also did some *Common Lisp* where I learned to be conscious of the performance of my code while doing some gamedev.
