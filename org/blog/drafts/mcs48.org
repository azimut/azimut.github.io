* The Hardware
** MCU
Is an 80C42, a mcs-48 chip made by NEC. As with anyone of the family it has the peculiarity that it uses the same physical pins for r/w data and for addressing (D0-D7).

Some Extra notes to not forget:
- SS# should be tied to V+ when not used.
- different RD#(8) and WR#(10) are inputs from the _master chip_ to enable either, not probes like in 8048
- new A_0(9) input from the _master chip_ to indicate if it is tranfering data or a command
- new SYNC(11) output clock signal which occurs once per cycle

- INT# -> CS#
- PSEN# -> A_0
- ALE -> SYNC
** Address Latch
A 74373. We need this to mediate between the EEPROM and the MCU to toggle depending on wether we are giving an address or fetching some data from it.
