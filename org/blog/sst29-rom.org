#+TITLE: Arduino: How to kill an EEPROM
#+DATE: <2025-04-14 lun>
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

I found on of these on an old motherboard. My initial happiness vanished as soon as I discovered that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K88pgWhEb1M][Ben Eater's]] EEPROM programmer script won't work right out of the box.

Turns out that it has some sort of write protection. Which complicates the writting (and reading?).

* Spoilers from the future

This is probably just interesting to me. But It kind of helped me keep my sanity in the process. Regardless of the results....

* Background
** The Hardware

- An arduino UNO: I am a bit limited in the number of digital pins. And i am not sure if i could use the analog ones. So at the very least I need to keep using the bitshifters for the address stuff.

*** The EEPROM

****  Read Protocol

- Controlled by CE# and OE# (# means active low)
  - both have to be low/active

- Seems pretty normal, at least compared to *28c256* which Ben Eater used.

** Stab #0

Luckly I found some [[https://github.com/slu4coder/SST39SF010-FLASH-Programmer][code]] on the internet that someone with seemly the same EEPROM. Using the arduino ide to write on it. Unfortunely it used a different board. Not the arduino UNO that I own. One with more IO pins that not needed the bit shifters.

So I adapted the code to work with.

Problem is that the handshake seems to require CE. So I am going to have to use one of those analogue pins.

** Stab #1 - Mission failure

It didn't work :(

Maybe I am doing something wrong.

Dealing with the frustuations of hardware hits different. Sure my code may be the problem, but the looming ghost that my faulty wiring is the issue.

Redid the wiring. Still no luck.

I need to develop a better workflow. Maybe think in smaller. Use leds or a separate board to constantly check stuff.

** Stab #2

+Seems like some of the random 00 reading i was getting may be related to magnetic fields of my monitor...may need to consider purchase a new one.+ ~the problem seems to happen when i run the erasememory() aka mess with CE~

Still, the problem of not being able to write persists.

Decided to browse on the internet for more code. I remembered also the [[https://github.com/slu4coder/SST39SF010-FLASH-Programmer/blob/main/Arduino_SST39SF0x0/Arduino_SST39SF0x0.ino][code]] i saw that works to write flash memories.

- "5555" and "2AAA" seem good enough strings to put on github search
- seems like the flash writing code also uses this handshake for writing

Since I have already CE on analog, maybe I can put OE there too and unburden the shiftregister of it.

** Stab #3

I think I succeded in erasing it...or I fried it.

I see all 0's. I was checking what was causing those random zeros. And I unplugged the power of the board live and plug it again....

...

nvm, i am back to getting zeroes at random, with some bits I recognize from before, so the data is still there. To illustrate:

#+begin_src

#+end_src

This happened after finally using a separate pin for OE. But i dunno...

** Stab #4

I changed the *Serial.begin()* velocity from 57600 to 9600. A noticeable change seems to be that the random zeros now happens in clusters (?. Always in different places.

#+end_src

Also when I started fresh after being unplugged for hours. It started showing no zeros. Only after trying to write something i saw this.

** Stab #5 - ✡️

I sacrificed a 3d printer to get an Arduino Mega to try without the register shifters.

In the process I learned how to dump the binary flash content of an arduino to a file with *avrdude*.

#+CAPTION: writes its output to flashdump.bin
#+begin_src sh
  $ avrdude -D -p atmega2560 -c wiring -P /dev/ttyACM0 -U flash:r:flashdump.bin:r -v
#+end_src

Now, I am getting weird inconsistent readings...redoing the wiring...

** Stab #6 - 💀

I think I fried the chip...all returns 0...

#+end_src

Now that I have a board with enough pins, I tried directly with the script the used the teensy to program this memory.

Same reading. So my code is NOT the issue in this case.

Wiring?

** Stab #7 - Adios

Alright, rewired but using the Arduino UNO again with the bitshifters.

I would like to say that I know the pins by hearth now, but I also fried the chip so...

...

Nope, also zeroes, chip is gonezo, caput, se fini, au revoir, adios.

** Stab #8 - 🧟‍♂️

I wanted to see if my reading make sense so I intended to tie the reading of D2 to V+. But...

Another misswiring.

I wired A16 to D2 on the EEPROM and the reading of D2 to V+.

Resulted into this reading.

#+end_src

Notice that, the "2c 2c" are back. And zeroes are filled with "04".

So...I fixed the wiring and...

#+end_src

No random "00" anymore.

This is annoying.

I guess the most problematic part is that this chip has *memory*. So the old turn it off and turning it on might not work all the time.

In this case maybe it remembered some bad command I sent until I shook ⚡ it off...

* Conclusion?

Either was wiring or the 2.2uf capacitors that I added at some point for decoupling fried it.
