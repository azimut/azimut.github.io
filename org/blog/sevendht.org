* Components

Digging through old projects I took a stab to try to make 2 different things work together.

- A two digit 7-segment display controled by an =SDA2131= display driver. Found already wired together on a pcb board  in an old pc.

- A =DHT11= temperature and humidity sensor. That I bought a while back, when I was turning on and off leds with an arduino.

* Implementation

Thanks to its [[https://arwill.hu/forras/termek/felvezetok/ic-k/analog/sda2131-integralt-aramkor-604654.pdf][datasheet]] and someones [[https://github.com/fernando-inf/SIEMENS-SDA2131-Display_7_Segments][arduino code]] to control it I was able to understand how make it work.

For =SDA2131= basically you just send *16 bits* of DATA representing if a segment should be on or off at a given CLOCK time.

For =DHT11= is simpler from the Arduino point of view since there is a library already for it. But it's a similar protocol (albeit more a synchronous and time based protocol) thanks to an embedded microcontroller *inside* the sensor.

** Challenge

I wasn't obvious how to convert from a binary representation of a number from =DHT11= to a list of bits of segments. I ended up decomposing the number in his digits and then mapping with an array of predefined bits was enough for this (see ~WriteNum()~).

** Code
