Digging through old projects I took a stab to try to make 2 different things work together.

1) A two digit seven-segment display controled by an =SDA2131= display driver. Found in an old pc.
2) A =DHT11= temperature and humidity sensor. That I bought a while back, when I was turning on and off leds with an arduino.

* Implementation

Thanks to its [[https://arwill.hu/forras/termek/felvezetok/ic-k/analog/sda2131-integralt-aramkor-604654.pdf][datasheet]] and someones [[https://github.com/fernando-inf/SIEMENS-SDA2131-Display_7_Segments][arduino code]] to control it I was able to understand how make it work.

For 1) basically you just send *16 bits* of DATA representing if a segment should be on or off at a given CLOCK time.

For 2) is simpler from the Arduino point of view since there is a library already for it. But it's a similar protocol (albeit more a synchronous and time based protocol) thanks to an embedded microcontroller *inside* the sensor.

** Gotchas

There was one, and that was converting from a binary representation of a number from DHT11 to a list of bits of segments. Decomposing the number in his digits and then mapping with an array of predefined bits was enough for this (see WriteNum()).
