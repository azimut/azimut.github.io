# My Personal Website

Currently I am building this site with Emacs's org-mode [html-exporter](https://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/ox-overview.html). Which means that it translates my markup language of choice (Org) to HTML.

The site is build and published through custom `Github Actions`.

To add style and animations I am injecting custom `Javascript`, `CSS` and `HTML` to the generated output.
